For executing our code in your computer, first of all you need a structure like:
        VWebsite(Optional)-
                -static-|
                        |-images-|
                        |        |-home_page_image.png
                        |        |-team_photo.jpeg
                        |        |-Vespera_logo.jpeg
                        |        |-Vespera_logo.ico
                        |        |-vespera_logo_colorful.jpeg
                        |        |-vespera_logo_colorful-removebg-preview.png
                        |-templates-|
                        |           |-home.html
                        |           |-about.html 
                        |           |-analyze.html
                        |           |-compare.html
                        |           |-data.html
                        |-App.py

Then on cmd: cd Website                                                    - to enter this folder 
           : python -m venv venv                                           - to create virtual environment named venv
           : venv\scripts\activate                                         - to enter this virtual environment, (venv) will occur at the left side of the screen
           : pip install pandas numpy flask xgboost scikit-learn           - to install required libraries
           : python App.py                                                 - to run the code
Then if done correctly, you should get a link for our website that you can click while pressing ctrl to open our website. Now you can analyze as much as you want â˜º.
